Hello, my name is Tit Petric. I'm a Senior Engineer working on Go code at [Tyk Technologies](https://tyk.io).
I'm working on back-end code for the open source [Tyk API Gateway](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk) and
other internal projects like the [Tyk Dashboard](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-dashboard/).

I've started the Semgrep Code Intelligence project to collect test
utilities, tooling, static analysis reports, code review feedback,
experiments and other development efforts aimed to improve the process
around development and the overall vibe of the codebase. Knowing what to
fix requires knowing what is there and how it's coupled.

### Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have a go project and you're interested in
code analysis. I'm working on several custom reports based on go test
data and a github action that would let you know how dangerous the area
the change touches is, and if there are any breaking API changes in a PR.

It's not about enforcement however, it's about knowledge. The more you
know about the code base, the better you are equipped to solve it's
defects. Knowing how to address them safely is the battle.
