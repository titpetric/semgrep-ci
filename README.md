# Semgrep CI website

Hello, my name is Tit Petric. I'm a Senior Engineer working on Go code at
[Tyk Technologies](https://tyk.io). I'm working on back-end code for the
open source [Tyk API Gateway](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk) and
the [Tyk Dashboard](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-dashboard/) API management
product.

I've started the Semgrep Code Intelligence project to collect test
utilities, toolings, reports, code review feedback, experiments and other
development efforts aimed to improve the process around development and
the overall vibe of the codebase. Knowing what to fix requires knowing
what is there and how it's coupled.

This is the source repository for the
[blog.semgrep-ci.com](https://blog.semgrep-ci.com) website. It contains
all the source articles supporting the project goals.
